## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?
 I'm building a snake game where the player collects food to grow the snake and avoid walls or itself. 
 i'm using simple graphics and a grid system to make the game the speed increases as the snake grows 
 and its tracking the score and hig scores. i also want the color of the snake to change after eating.
