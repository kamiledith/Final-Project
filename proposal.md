# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

The best Snake Game

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

I'm building a snake game where the player collects food to grow the snake and avoid walls or itself. 
 
## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

i'm using simple graphics and a grid system to make the game the speed increases as the snake grows 
 and its tracking the score and hig scores. i also want the color of the snake to change after eating. 


## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

no

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

no

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.
