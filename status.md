#### What have you done for your project so far?

i decided to change my project to a snake eating game because my other project idea was not working out for me. I'm building a snake game where the player collects food to grow the snake and avoid walls or itself. i'm to using simple graphics and a grid system to make the game the speed increases as the snake grows and its tracking the score and hig scores.
